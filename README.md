# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The reason for this project was to understand some of the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. This project will allow me to go back and look at notes that i took while learning the basics to help me further my knowledge about these three languages. It consolidates all my notes into one single location. I learned how to start a project, how to format an HTML page, how to style the page using CSS, and all about different veriables, functions, arrays, and loops in JavaScript. I also learned how to use Git to keep version control of the project as well as merge different branches into the main branch.
